# PROJECT: DESIGN TEARDOWN

In this simple project, you’ll be breaking apart the website for a popular design magazine with which you’re probably familiar by now – Smashing Magazine. The goal for this exercise is to start training yourself to think in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles.

Your job is to create a grayscale heat map of the website that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy. For inspiration, check out this image from vanseodesign.com which compares a site layout with no differentiation on the left to one with a thoughtful hierarchy on the right. Your final product will look much like the site on the right.

This is also an opportunity to get better at positioning <div> elements without worrying too much about what’s inside them, which will serve you well later.ß
